# stbl
Functions for working with alpha-stable distributions in MATLAB. Used to generate samples from a distribution with our desired parameterization.

Code developed by Mark Veillette who holds the copyright. Obtained from [GitHub](https://github.com/markveillette/stbl), with documentation [available here](http://math.bu.edu/people/mveillet/html/alphastablepub.html).


# apd
Contains a function for estimating the amplitude probably distribution function.

This function was written by R. J. Achatz et al. and included
in a report for the [IEEE 802.15 working group for WPANS](http://www.ieee802.org/15/pub/04/15-04-0428-00-003a-estimating-and-graphing-amplitude-probability-distribution-function.pdf) under the title:
